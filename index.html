                    ...worked as a Senior Developer on an agile development team implementing a Data Visualisation Platform used by two large retail banks. He got up to speed very quickly with the initial MEAN Stack application and picked up Loopback and Angular 2 with similar ease when we switched to more up to date technologies. He is always keen to implement and follow recognised best practices and regularly provided help and advice to the rest of the team both on the technical side and on our overall agile process. I would happily employ him again on a future project.

I enjoyed pairing with him, particularly for his insights and nimble sense of humour; as well, whenever there was a pressing problem, he stayed until it was resolved. ... would be an asset to whatever project, for whatever duration.
